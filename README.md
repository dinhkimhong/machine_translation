# machine_translation
Build a model to translate from English sentences to French sentences.

The model is trained by 110,288 sentences with 200 english words and 344 french words.

I have build a small web app for this translation. Run the command: "python app.py" to run the app.

The demo is at https://www.loom.com/share/b49c847718b047c2876c756e6c0970f1
